						This is second part of pragmatic functional programming tutorial for Java developers. If you read my previous post regarding
						<a href="functional-programming-magic.html">what functional programming is</a>
						, well ... <em>I'm glad you are back :)</em> If you didn't, <em>please take a look there</em> as I'm going to write about concepts described previously.
					</p>
					<p>We know basic concepts and techniques of functional programming. It's time for some advertising, why it's good to use those techniques and concepts
						and how they will improve our code.</p>
					<h1>Parallel computations</h1>
					<p>
						If we look at microprocessors parameters historical data, like here:
						<a href="https://www.karlrupp.net/2018/02/42-years-of-microprocessor-trend-data/">42 Years of Microprocessor Trend Data </a>
						, we can draw interesting conclusions.
						<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law">Moore's law</a>
						still holds as number of transistors grows exponentially. Single thread performance increases slightly. The number of cores increases with a power law.
					</p>
					<p>Once we have multiple cores available, it's not the big deal to make our programs concurrent. Just spawn tasks in separate threads and we are done.
						The real difficulty is in making our programs parallel.</p>
					<p class="note">
						There is essential difference between <em>concurrent</em> and <em>parallel</em> programs. <em>Concurrent</em> programs are capable to do different things
						at the same time, like accepting keyboard input and writing to disk simultaneously. <em>Parallel</em> programs are able to split single task into smaller
						parts and execute them in the same time on different processor cores or cluster nodes to complete faster, like sorting or computing some value from large
						data set.
					</p>
					<p>There is difficult task of performing parallel computations at the front of us, to benefit from increasing microprocessors computation power and
						different approaches to parallelism exist.</p>
					<h2>Java concurrency model</h2>
					<p>
						The traditional approach in Java is to use shared state and protect it against concurrent access. Simply stating: <span class="badge badge-secondary">1</span>
						we run tasks simultaneously in separate threads, <span class="badge badge-secondary">2</span> every task updates shared state on completion, <span
							class="badge badge-secondary">3</span> we assure that only one task can update shared state at the same time. We can protect shared state using Java
						language built in features like <code>synchronized</code> methods and blocks, locking primitives from <code>java.util.concurrent.locks</code> core
						package. Looks easy and it is indeed ... for simple cases, but believe me, it's rapidly becoming extremely complex for more sophisticated cases. We can
						make our programs thread safe by synchronizing all shared states, but it makes them serial and our parallelism goes down the drain. We can make our
						programs more parallel by careful design, but we expose ourselves to multiple dangers like:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>race conditions</li>
						<li>threads starvation, deadlock and similar effects</li>
						<li>testing difficulties</li>
						<li>context switching overhead</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Above issues produce many bugs, usually occurring in production environments and almost impossible to reproduce and test.</p>
					<p class="note">
						According to Murphy's law, <em>If something can go wrong, it will go wrong ... when we are on vacations ... and our sales guys are performing VERY
							IMPORTANT presentation for VERY IMPORTANT prospect client</em>.
					</p>
					<p>Traditional model is difficult, lets consider some other options.</p>
					<h2>Parallelism in functional programming</h2>
					<p>
						In functional programming we use <em>pure functions</em> to construct our programs. It implies no side effects nor shared state, so there is no need for
						synchronization. There are several fundamental concepts related to parallel computations done functional way.
					</p>
					<h3>Divisibility</h3>
					<p>
						Before we start to parallelize our computation, we have to answer very important question - <em>Can it be parallelized at all?</em>
					</p>
					<p class="note">To be precise, divisibility feature is crucial to parallel computation in general, not only done functional way.</p>
					<p>
						The answer depends on it's ability to be divided into pieces that can be executed in parallel. The bigger part of program can be parallelized then better.
						However, there are some theoretical limits described by
						<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law">Amdahl's law</a>
						. Deciding if our program is a good candidate for parallelization is sometimes difficult. Usually we have some source of data and run computation on every
						element from this source. More divisible is the source and more costly is the single element processing, chances are higher that we can benefit from
						running it in parallel manner. However we split our job, either recursively or by some collection division, we need to take care of available parallelism
						level determined by number of cores or nodes.
					</p>
					<h3>Lazy evaluation</h3>
					<p>
						By <em>lazy evaluation</em> I mean function arguments evaluation. In Java, whenever we pass arguments to function they are evaluated eagerly, before
						function's body is executed. The good practical example of lazy evaluation is <code>Optional.orElseGet()</code> method. Let's say we have some function
						returning optional value. In case of empty value returned we want to supply default value, but obtaining it requires some time.
					</p>
					<pre><code class="language-java" data-src="../src/main/java/tech/daniellas/p2/EagerLazyEvaluation.java" data-format="lines 9,23"></code></pre>
					<p>
						If we'll use <code>Optional.orElse()</code> method, default value will be calculated regardless of returned value existence.
					</p>
					<pre><code class="language-java" data-src="../src/main/java/tech/daniellas/p2/EagerLazyEvaluation.java" data-format="lines 25,29"></code></pre>
					<p>
						This is happening because Java evaluates method arguments before it's body is executed. Some programming languages act oppositely, evaluate arguments only
						when they are required. To fix the issue in our code, we need to use <code>Optional.orElseGet()</code>
					</p>
					<pre><code class="language-java" data-src="../src/main/java/tech/daniellas/p2/EagerLazyEvaluation.java" data-format="lines 31,41"></code></pre>
					<p>
						Our code works as expected now because we pass <code>java.util.function.Supplier</code> to <code>Optional.orElseGet()</code> method. It's still evaluated
						eagerly but inside method's body there must be <code>Supplier.get()</code> method called to get value we want to use. We can decide if we call this method
						or not.
					</p>
					<p>
						How lazy evaluation applies to parallel computations? Well, it fits perfectly. During parallel computation we split our problem, delegate it's components
						resolution to be processed in parallel, either wait for partial results or are notified when they arrives and finally combine them into single result.
						Awaiting some result is well abstracted by <code>java.util.concurrent.Future</code> class. Let's look at it's <code>get()</code> method:
					</p>
					<pre><code class="language-java" data-src="../src/main/java/tech/daniellas/p2/Future.java" data-format="lines 6,6"></code></pre>
					<p>
						and compare to <code>java.util.function.Supplier</code> interface:
					</p>
					<pre><code class="language-java" data-src="../src/main/java/tech/daniellas/p2/Supplier.java" data-format="lines 4,4"></code></pre>
					<p>
						The only difference is that <code>Future.get()</code> throws exceptions in case of interruption or failure.
					</p>
					<p class="note">Lazy evaluation concept is inevitable when we run parallel computation.</p>
