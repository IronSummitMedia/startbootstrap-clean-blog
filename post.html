                    <p>Digital Anthropology Is a new field that is continually growing and shaping even as you are reading this. Within the field of Digital Archeology there is public Anthropology. This is a new way to spread the word about different anthropological and archeological sites. Public Anthropology is also a good way to get a community informed and integrated within the site itself.
                   
                    <p>For this project I have decided to talk about the new Mammoth exhibit at the Royal BC Museum. Different attractions come into the museum ever few months however I feel that this one is more significant then others because there were Woolly Mammoths in BC when humans were here.  However I wanted to see how the community felt about this exhibit. Therefore I have set up my website to give some information about the Exhibit itself. There is another page were I have put some articles that I have found important or prominent to this topic. Within this section I am encouraging the community to give there input. Anything that they send to me I will repost into the blog if they so wish.
                  
                    <p>For the first page or home page I wanted something that was pleasing to the eye. As soon as you open the website there is a large picture of Mammoth with some quick blurbs that people have written that are positive about the exhibit. I did this to try to get the people excited about the exhibit and more importantly the website and the interactive aspect of it so people could be encouraged to write in.</p>
                  
                    <blockquote> What I am trying to display with this website is an interactive, vibrant experience for the community of Victoria to enjoy. With appealing pictures and context that the young and old alike can enjoy.</blockquote>
                    
                    <p>The second portion of the website is the about the exhibit section. For this section I have added some details about what the exhibit itself is and also how it was built. This sections gives the reader a synopsis of some of the important facts about the exhibit.</p>

                    <p>The third page of the Community Comments section is where the community can comment about the exhibit, what they did or did not like about it, what they would change, if they would change anything about it, whether they feel it effects the public at all, good for tourism… ect. I feel that this could be a great section for victorites because it can help the museum know what the public wants for the next main attraction and also if there are things to change with this one now or if it were to come back
                        
                    <p>Lastly we have the Contact page, which is where people can send there comments so that I can add them to the site. </p>
                    
                    <p>I found this website quite difficult to build. Computer programming has never been a fortay of mine. But I buckled down and tried some stuff. I went in to talk to my professor which I found quite useful then the next class I tried to apply all that we had talked about. Still tis was not working, then we realized how to actually look at the site you were changing and then it all hit me. The lightbulb moment hit me hard, it all started to make sense. Since that moment of realization of who to actually code this it was smoother sailing. I still have some problems with pages not loading but all and all I am pleased with how it is turning out and I feel that people could actually utilize this website now.</p>
                    
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Making the Mammoth</h2>
                    
                    <p>The techniques used to develop the model of the mammoth were developed by Vancouver-based Topographics using such cutting-edge technology as three-dimensional scanning of the maquette into a full size animal. The form was then cut into layers by a computer.</p>

                    <p>Richard Gibbs did the taxidermy on Woolly. His deft touch has much to do with the longevity and hyper-realism of the display.</p>

                    <p>“We wanted a really dynamic introduction to the Natural History section, and going back to when the Strait of Juan de Fuca was actually a grassy plain and mammoths would have been very common,” said Gibbs. “The scene could be Victoria, as they are still finding tusks and more in the Butler Brothers pit in central Saanich to this day. The musk ox fur was an obvious choice as they exist in the same environment and many remains have been found along with those of mammoths.”</p>

                    <p>Gibbs notes that hair discovered in permafrost sites obviously changes colour when it has been underground for tens of thousands of years. So the team was working on “best guess” as well as scientific research coming up with the final look of Woolly. Nine hides were needed in total and a enormous amount of labour went into getting the right texture aligned to body placement, the right nape and the right colour. </p>

                    <p>It took a year to complete Woolly, and a great deal of maintenance goes into keeping the replica in tip-top condition as the display is exposed to the open air, dust and other deleterious influences. The size made encasing it in a glass case unwieldy, and also just didn’t seem to fit the look of the scene.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">SEE A WOOLLY MAMMOTH!</h2>

                    <p> Watch out kids! It’s coming right for us! It was very cool to see a Woolly Mammoth the way they used to be when they roamed around Vancouver Island. We were very surprised to find real ice on one of the walls of the exhibit, we thought for sure it was fake… that is, until our 5 year old’s busy hands made contact. Just another place where the museum goes above and beyond to help the exhibits come to life.</p>
