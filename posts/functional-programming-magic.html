					<p>This is first part of pragmatic functional programming tutorial for Java developers. It's based on my experience taken from lessons of functional
						programming in Java I give at work.</p>
					<p class="text-center">
						<em>I hope you will enjoy it as much as I do teaching it.</em>
					</p>
					<p>
						Functional programming is difficult. It's building blocks are simple but if you are regular Java developer you need to change your perspective and shift
						paradigm to learn it. It borrows a lot from <em>Category Theory</em>, developed own jargon difficult to grasp at the beginning, uses recursion and
						sophisticated data structures extensively.
					</p>
					<p>
						It's not for everyone because people think and solve problems in different ways. For some of us, it's natural to think about objects encapsulating some
						state and communicating with each other. Some of us prefer to think in terms of some data being passed through chain of transformations to get final
						desired result. Both ways are <em>Turing equivalent</em> (equally powerful), just like <em>Turing Machine</em> and <em>Lambda Calculus</em>. Ultimately,
						functional programs are merely nice abstraction on top of fast <em>Turing machines</em>.
					</p>
					<p>So what's the point? Is it worth to learn at all? Yes, I believe it is. It adds several superpowers to our programming toolkit and I will show you
						what these powers are and how to use them.</p>
					<h2 class="section-heading">But what is functional programming?</h2>
					<p>This is not an easy question and answer usually depends on whom you ask. Here below you find basic concepts and techniques description.</p>
					<h3>Program with Pure Functions</h3>
					<p>This sounds reasonable, functional programming must have something to do with functions, right?</p>
					<p class="note">The very first step in learning functional programming is to model the problem solution in terms of pure functions.</p>
					<p>Instead of mutating objects like here:</p>
					<pre><code class="language-java" data-src="../src/main/java/tech/daniellas/p1/imp/Player.java"></code></pre>
					<p>Use pure functions to provide desired answers without object mutations:</p>
					<pre><code class="language-java" data-src="../src/main/java/tech/daniellas/p1/fun/Player.java"></code></pre>
					<p class="note">
						Here you saw first code examples and might miss <code>private</code> or <code>public</code> modifiers. I did it by purpose to make code shorter. I will
						often omit import declarations , getters and setters for the same reason.
					</p>
					<p>What makes function pure?</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Pure function takes some value and returns some value only</li>
						<li>Pure function is side effects free</li>
						<li>Pure function depends only on it's arguments</li>
						<li>Pure function returns the same result if applied to the same arguments, always</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="note">
						Please remember, we say <em>apply function to arguments</em> and not <em>apply arguments to function</em>.
					</p>
					<pre><code class="language-java" data-src="../src/main/java/tech/daniellas/p1/Funcs.java" data-format="skip-class"></code></pre>
					<p>
						This is nice function, beautiful in it's purity and simplicity. It does only one thing. It takes <code>Integer</code> type argument and returns new <code>Integer</code>
						number. It doesn't change it's arguments. Actually it can't because <code>java.lang.Integer</code> is immutable. It is side effects free, meaning that no
						external state is modified, no external variables are assigned. It reads no external variable, all it needs are function's arguments. It is <code>static</code>
						method, what makes <code>this</code> reference not accessible inside body. It can be non static for your convenience, just don't access <code>this</code>
						in body.
					</p>
					<p>One might argue that it should be:</p>
					<pre><code class="language-java" data-src="../src/main/java/tech/daniellas/p1/FuncsFinal.java" data-format="skip-class"></code></pre>
					<p>
						The <code>final</code> modifier used in argument protects functions's code from assigning argument reference with new value:
					</p>
					<pre><code class="language-java" data-src="../src/main/java/tech/daniellas/p1/FuncsFinalFail.java" data-format="skip-class"></code></pre>
					<p>
						But I'm personally not very strict in using <code>final</code> modifiers in arguments declaration due to it's verbosity. Just keep your functions small
						and never ever use arguments reassignments, or use <code>final</code> modifiers and let Java compiler protect you from such smelly practices.
					</p>
					<p>
						<em>There are very important consequences of function purity.</em> To understand what function is doing, you only need to see it's body. To test it, you
						only need to invoke it and assert result. There are no surprises, no looking around your code to check whether external variable used by your function is
						modified by external code. And last but not least <em>Referential Transparency</em> - concept I will explain in next parts.
					</p>
					<p class="note">Whatever programming language you use, just follow pure functions rules to start programming functional way.</p>
					<h3>Higher order functions</h3>
					<p>Higher order functions is very simple yet powerful concept. It's just function taking another function as argument or function returning function.</p>
					<pre><code class="language-java" data-src="../src/main/java/tech/daniellas/p1/hof/Player.java"></code></pre>
					<p>
						<code>hasAge</code> is a higher order function because it accepts <code>java.util.function.Predicate&lt;Integer&gt;</code> as it's argument. Predicate is
						a generic function taking given type argument and returning <code>boolean</code>.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you'd ask me if given programming language supports functional programming style, my answer would depend on it's capability of treating functions as <em>first
							class citizen</em>:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>can function be passed as an argument to other function</li>
						<li>can function be returned from function</li>
						<li>can function be assigned to variable or constant</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="note">
						If above conditions are met, you can program functional way. This is functional programming magic. You can build powerful abstractions using very simple
						concept of <em>higher order functions</em>
					</p>
					<h3>Currying and Partial Application</h3>
					<p>Currying and partial application are closely related and extremely useful techniques. We use them to manipulate existing functions and construct new
						functions from existing functions. It's very common and handy that we create new functions from available building blocks. Currying and partial
						application are conceptually similar to Object Oriented Programming and it's Design Patterns, where basic concepts are inheritance, polymorphism and
						composition. In OOP we use Design Patterns and in FP we use higher order functions, currying and partial application to construct our code abstractions.</p>
					<p>
						Let's look at currying first. The name of this technique is taken from <em>Haskel Curry</em>, American mathematician. The idea is based on the fact:
					</p>
					<p class="note">Every pure function accepting multiple arguments can be transformed to higher order function taking single argument and returning
						function taking single argument and returning function taking single argument and ... so on, depending on arguments number of function we curry.</p>
					<p>
						Actually, in some programming languages like <em>Haskel</em> we define our functions in curried form by default.
					</p>
					<p>This is simple example of currying:</p>
					<pre><code class="language-java" data-src="../src/main/java/tech/daniellas/p1/Currying.java" data-format="skip-class"></code></pre>
					<p>
						Unfortunately there is no native support of currying in Java so curried form declaration: <code>Function&lt;Integer, Function&lt;Integer,
							Integer&gt;&gt;</code> looks weird and is difficult to read. Fortunately there are some mitigation techniques I'll show you later. Despite the lack of currying
						support, it's easy to write generic function transforming any <code>BiFunction</code> to curried form.
					</p>
					<pre><code class="language-java" data-src="../src/main/java/tech/daniellas/p1/FunctionsCurry.java" data-format="skip-class"></code></pre>
					<p>
						Our <code>curry</code> function is the nice example of higher order function. It takes function as an argument and returns function. You deserve warning
						now. This is how functional programming code often looks. Please try to understand what's going on in above and following examples and I promise, it will
						pay of in the near future.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you wonder how currying might me useful, let me show you one example. Many core Java 8 functions expect <code>Function</code> as it's only argument,
						like <code>map</code> in <code>Optional</code> or <code>Stream</code>.
					</p>
					<p>
						If we have some <code>BiFunction</code> we can curry it and pass to <code>Stream.map()</code> or <code>Optional.map()</code> functions without wrapping it
						with some private function or using lambda expression.
					</p>
					<pre><code class="language-java" data-src="../src/main/java/tech/daniellas/p1/FunctionsCurryExamples.java" data-format="skip-class"></code></pre>
					<p>
						It's time to tackle partial application now. Do you remember our <code>inc</code> function from previous example? What we did was:
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							we took available function <code>sum</code> accepting two arguments
						</li>
						<li>
							transformed it to different function by currying it, so we had <code>Function&lt;Integer,Function&lt;Integer,Integer&gt;&gt;</code>
						</li>
						<li>
							applied our function with value <code>1</code>
						</li>
						<li>
							and finally assigned result: <code>Function&lt;Integer,Integer&gt;</code> to constant
						</li>
					</ol>
					<p>
						Written code is as terse as <code>curry(sum).apply(1)</code>. Do you see the pattern? Whenever we see the pattern we abstract it. That's what we do as
						programmers. Since this post is about functional programming, lets abstract partial application into function.
					</p>
					<pre><code class="language-java" data-src="../src/main/java/tech/daniellas/p1/Partial.java" data-format="skip-class"></code></pre>
					<p>
						I wrote that currying and partial application are closely related because we can write <code>partial</code> function using <code>curry</code> function
						like in this code:
					</p>
					<pre><code class="language-java" data-src="../src/main/java/tech/daniellas/p1/PartialViaCurry.java" data-format="skip-class"></code></pre>
					<p>
						You saw the examples of functions transforming other functions like <code>curry</code> or <code>partial</code> and can feel a bit confused. Let me give
						you some exercises to let you practice and get better intuition in manipulating functions.
					</p>
					<p class="exc">
						Write function transforming any two arguments function into two arguments function with arguments reversed.
						<a class="ans" data-toggle="collapse" href="#reverse">Show answer</a>
					</p>
					<pre class="collapse" id="reverse"><code class="language-java" data-src="../src/main/java/tech/daniellas/p1/Reverse.java" data-format="skip-class"></code></pre>
					<p class="exc">

					<p class="exc">
						Write function currying any two arguments function from the right using <code>reverse</code> function.
						<a class="ans" data-toggle="collapse" href="#curryRightReverse">Show answer</a>
					</p>
					<pre class="collapse" id="curryRightReverse"><code class="language-java" data-src="../src/main/java/tech/daniellas/p1/CurryRightViaReverse.java"
						data-format="skip-class"></code></pre>
