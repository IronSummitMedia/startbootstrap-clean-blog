The Liahona represents...the scriptures, the prophets

In the compass I was given, I found a thin space in the compass. I also saw a hinge which got me curious. I found out how to open the compass and inside I found markings showing degrees which help you further navigate. I related this to personal revelation and seeking God's word. As you search the scriptures, more detail and guidance are open to you (insert scripture) and you are able to find your way.

The world can change direction, but the compass still points the way.
