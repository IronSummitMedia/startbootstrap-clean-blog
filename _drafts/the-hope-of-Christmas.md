There have been many people who made poor decisions in their lives. Scrooge, the Grinch, and even Paul the Apostle of the Bible. Common among these is that all changed. All became better people.

In the end, Scrooge found the Spirit of Christmas. Call him Ebenezer.
He may have sung "Here I raise my Ebenezer, hither by Thy help I've come." Because of the gift of God's Son, Ebenezer was able to make it to where he was and was able to change. He had a moment, an Ebenezer he could raise to remember God's help in getting him to that point.

The Grinch is another example of someone who did wrong, yet the Spirit of Christmas, the Spirit of Christ, led him to change, led him to repent.

Saul let Jesus change his life and became Paul the Apostle going on to strengthen the Church through his powerful letters.

My friends, there is hope for you. You can change. There is a reason Christ came to earth. He came to earth for you.

Even if others only see you for your sin, He doesn't see you that way. He sees you for the good you do, for who you can become. If you don't yet feel this, or believe this, I invite you to come to know the Savior. He knows you and wants you to feel of His love.
