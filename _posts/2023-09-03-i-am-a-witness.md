I am a witness that God is present in our lives and that He loves us very much. I have had too many experiences to be coincidences. People saying exactly what I need to hear, what’s been weighing on my heart that I haven’t told anyone. God has shown forth His power in my life, given me new friends, and spoken to me from His heart to mine.

## My Invitation to You
I know that He loves you just as much as He loves me. If you don’t feel that, keep trying, keep working. He is there waiting for you. He wants you to have joy. It takes patience, it takes time, but in the end, it’s worth every second. I know this to be true.
