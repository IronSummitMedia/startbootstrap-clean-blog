## My Reading
I am reading in a part of the scriptures where a prophet Nephi stops sharing his words and starts sharing what Isaiah said. I couldn't help but wonder why. I came up with a list of a few reasons Nephi gave for reading the words of Isaiah.

- Isaiah saw the Savior.
- God sends many witnesses of Christ. [(2 Nephi 11:4, 6)](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/11?lang=eng&id=p4,p6#p4)
- Sharing the covenants Christ made with Nephi's ancestors. [(2 Nephi 11:5)](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/11?lang=eng&id=p5#p5)
- Proving that Christ would come to save His people. [(2 Nephi 11:6)](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/11?lang=eng&id=p6#p6)
- That we may rejoice reading what has been written.
- That we may apply the words to ourselves (even still today)! [(2 Nephi 11:8)](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/11?lang=eng&id=p8#p8)

## Discussion
Reading Isaiah, I have come to know my Savior and His infinite love for me.

What is one thing you have learned from the valuable words of Isaiah?

If you don't understand Isaiah, how might you work to understand?
