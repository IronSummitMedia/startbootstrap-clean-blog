Wednesday I had an amazing class on what we have learned recently. Here are points from my notes as well as my own thoughts.

- Christ overcame temptation because He looked to God.

- Christ knows you perfectly.

- Comparison is the thief of all joy and men are that they might have joy [(2 Nephi 2:25)](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2?id=p25&lang=eng#p25){:target="_blank"}.

- The world doesnâ€™t fill you. God does.

What I have learned recently:

- God loves me.

- He knows me perfectly.

- He wants me to succeed.
