[Romans 8:32](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rom/8?id=p32&lang=eng#p32){:target="_blank"}
> He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?

How can I not sacrifice everything for Him who sacrificed all for me?
