Recently I was in a meeting, and someone brought up a wonderful video on gratitude that was made during the COVID-19 pandemic:

<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/i51gcWCs-Ho' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

During the pandemic, a heart surgeon and spiritual leader gave for spiritual sickness, emotional sickness, and the other illnesses of the world an antidote: gratitude. In the video, he encouraged gratitude to God even in the trying time of the pandemic. Because of this, I wanted to give thanks for what God has given me. I want to encourage you to write and share what you are thankful for with your family or loved ones.

I am thankful for a warm bus to take me home in the cold weather.

I am thankful for food that is available to me so I have enough to eat.

I am thankful to be able to feel God's love for me and to be able to share it with others.
