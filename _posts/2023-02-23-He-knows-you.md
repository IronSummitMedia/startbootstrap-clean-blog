"The Savior knows your struggles in detail. He knows your great potential to grow in faith, hope, and charity."

Henry B Eyring -Â  ["Legacy of Encouragement"](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2022/10/51eyring?id=p30&lang=eng#p30) (October 2022)


This quote really hit me today. He really does know me. He knows you too and your potential. I invite you to pray to Him and ask what He would have you do today. I know He will answer.
