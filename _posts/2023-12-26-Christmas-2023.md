This Christmas was one of the most peaceful Christmases I remember. Just coming home Saturday evening after work was really nice. It felt good to be with family and it really started to feel like Christmas.


Sunday (Christmas Eve) I went to church with my family. It was an amazing hour of worship. There were talks that brought the Spirit and the music was absolutely wonderful.


Monday (Christmas Day) felt like Sunday after you get home from church. There's that good Spirit you feel after the meeting that I felt that day. I know it came from God. We were celebrating the birth of His Son who gave so much hope to this world and who still gives hope in whatever situation we may be in. This hope is being fulfilled now and will be fully realized when the Savior comes again.


For Christmas, I received some wonderful gifts. I got a daily calendar that has scriptures to read from The Book of Mormon - Another Testament of Jesus Christ along with a thought on how to act on what you read. I received a journal as well to record such thoughts. These were wonderful gifts. I received other gifts too, but those were the most meaningful and will help me grow closer to God as I go throughout this next year.
