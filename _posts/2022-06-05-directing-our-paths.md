Last week, I was reading the book of Jonah in the Old Testament. The first chapter really struck me. Jonah was running away from what the Lord had told him to do. Yet the Lord still had a plan for Jonah. Through Jonah, the Lord brought more people unto him (see verse 16). A great fish was also prepared for Jonah in the Lord's mercy (Vs. 17). As Jonah changed and turned to the Lord, the fish spat him out and Jonah chose to obey the Lord (Jonah 2).

I had a similar experience recently. I needed to get ready for work, but I had something else to do as well. I ended up leaving later than I have. I struggle already with getting to work on time and Google Maps' estimate had me worried. I ended up making it a minute or two before my shift. That was a huge miracle to me. It showed me that even though I had struggled and felt unhappy with all my mistakes, God still loved me and was helping me even if I struggled to make good choices.
