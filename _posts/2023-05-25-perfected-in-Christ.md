Yesterday I was studying my scriptures. I had a question and wanted to share what I learned studying with that question in mind.

What does it mean to be perfected in Christ? [(Moroni 10:32)](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/10?id=p32&lang=eng#p32)

It means:
- Becoming one with Him
- Becoming like Him
- Denying yourself of all ungodliness (things that would draw you away from God)
- Becoming clean! :)
- Being virtuous and touching no unclean thing [(Isaiah 52:11)](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/52?id=p11&lang=eng#p11).
- Becoming whole or compete in that sense of perfection through Christ
