## 3 reasons I'm thankful for the Savior's birth

- So we can have this special Christmas season in the year
- So I have a family I can be with forever
- So I can repent (change for the better) & be forgiven & improve my self each day.

## Your invitation
After Jesus was born, [Mary] pondered the events of the Nativity in her heart. Like her, you can reflect on the true meaning of Christmas. Find a quiet place and take a minute to write down three reasons why you are grateful for the birth of Jesus.
