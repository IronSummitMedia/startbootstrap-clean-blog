                    <p> Watch out kids! It’s coming right for us! It was very cool to see a Woolly Mammoth the way they used to be when they roamed around Vancouver Island. We were very surprised to find real ice on one of the walls of the exhibit, we thought for sure it was fake… that is, until our 5 year old’s busy hands made contact. Just another place where the museum goes above and beyond to help the exhibits come to life.</p>

                  <h2 class="section-heading">Making the Mammoth</h2>
                    
                    <p>The techniques used to develop the model of the mammoth were developed by Vancouver-based Topographics using such cutting-edge technology as three-dimensional scanning of the maquette into a full size animal. The form was then cut into layers by a computer.</p>

                    <p>Richard Gibbs did the taxidermy on Woolly. His deft touch has much to do with the longevity and hyper-realism of the display.</p>

                    <p>“We wanted a really dynamic introduction to the Natural History section, and going back to when the Strait of Juan de Fuca was actually a grassy plain and mammoths would have been very common,” said Gibbs. “The scene could be Victoria, as they are still finding tusks and more in the Butler Brothers pit in central Saanich to this day. The musk ox fur was an obvious choice as they exist in the same environment and many remains have been found along with those of mammoths.”</p>

                    <p>Gibbs notes that hair discovered in permafrost sites obviously changes colour when it has been underground for tens of thousands of years. So the team was working on “best guess” as well as scientific research coming up with the final look of Woolly. Nine hides were needed in total and a enormous amount of labour went into getting the right texture aligned to body placement, the right nape and the right colour. </p>

                    <p>It took a year to complete Woolly, and a great deal of maintenance goes into keeping the replica in tip-top condition as the display is exposed to the open air, dust and other deleterious influences. The size made encasing it in a glass case unwieldy, and also just didn’t seem to fit the look of the scene.</p>
